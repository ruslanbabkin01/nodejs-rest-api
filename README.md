# Getting Started
  * To run the API locally, you'll need to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your machine. You can then clone this repository and install its dependencies by running:

        git clone https://github.com/ruslanbabkin01/nodejs-rest-api.git
    
go to the folder

        cd nodejs-rest-api
    
then
    
        npm install

  * You'll also need to create a .env file in the root of the project, with the following environment variables (.env.example)
  * You can then start the server with:
  
        npm run start

 This will run the server in production mode, which serves the API at http://localhost:4321. 
 * If you want to run the server in development mode, with automatic reloading on file changes, you can use:
  
        npm run start:dev
